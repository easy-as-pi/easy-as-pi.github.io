             Title - Website Information
             This website was created by Prashanth Mohan, a student taking computer science classes
             Prashanth did not want to create this website, but was forced to as a final end-of-the-year project with a grade.
             Given that Prashanth already has an A in the class, he could have chosen to not do the project and still have passed the                  class.
             But he chose to make it for all those people who are really bad at Clash Royale
             "And belive me, there are some REALLY BAD people playing Clash Royale. Trust me, I play it" -Prashanth
             
             What Prashanth Does
             When not reading a physics book, he is usually thinking about how stupid other people are and how smart he is. Don't worry.                 He thinks you are smart. He is currently sad because he can't play Clash Royale until he takes the SAT. 5 more months to                 go. Please support this website by thinking: "Dang, Prashanth is really smart". He will hear your thoughts and will                     instantly feel better.
